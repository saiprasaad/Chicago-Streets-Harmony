    "description":"This is the story of how the South Side Irish St. Patrickâ€™s Parade began. As with many stories told by the Irish, exaggeration is inevitable; however, this story is completely true. The parade was the vision of two best friends, George Hendry and Pat Coakley. Both were raised on the South Side of Chicago, George in the St. Sabina Parish and Pat in the Little Flower parish in the Auburn neighborhood. The two did not meet until their early thirties, when both moved to the Morgan Park community with their young wives. There they became neighbors, best friends and in 1979, co-founders of the South Side Irish Parade.",

Around the turn of the century, the Greeks concen-trated around the Harrison, Blue Island and Halsted area, originally known as the as DeltaÃ®but later re-named as Greektown. During the 1960s,Greektown was displaced by the Eisenhower Expressway and the University of Illinois at Chicago, forcing a move north a few blocks.In 1968, gyros and saganaki (flaming cheese) were introduced in this country by Chicagoâ€™s Greektown. From 1970 to 1990, most of the current restaurants and businesses opened, and the Taste of Greece summer festival became a tradition. In 1996,with the Democratic National Convention coming to town, the city of Chicago recognized Greektownâ€™s contribution to the city by pouring millions of dollars into street renovations and erecting traditional Greek temples and pavilions at the major intersections in Greektown.",
